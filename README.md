# Assign2
Game of Life
I was working on my Assin2 earlier today. i was about to sumbit when after typing in git commit-m"upload HW" and it said something about merging so i did git pull. Then the files deleted after putting some git command and i looked up the error and it said to do git reflog so i did and it deleted my files. I tried to restore them that way, but it did not. I had to start from the begining.
